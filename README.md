# Project3: Women Trafficking in China

## Prompt

Last month, the video of a mother chained by the neck in a shed in a village of Jiangsu province, China, causes public outrage. She has given birth to eight children and is unable to communicate with people due to the cognitive impairment. Internet users started to question if she is a victim of abuse and human trafficking. The later statement from the local government failed to respond to public concerns, which spurred another round of rage in Chinese social media.

## Related media coverage

Some articles and study use data to explain the deep-rooted woman trafficking problem in China. But unfortunately, none of them strike a balance between deep data analysis and high-quality visualization for a journalism peice.

## The contribution of this project

This project will focus on the geographical disparity of woman trafficking.

In Yiwei Xia's [study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10670564.2019.1637564) published in 2019, the four provinces with the highest concentration of trafficking destinations are **Henan, Anhui, Shandong, and Hubei**. The intra-provincial women trafficking court cases from 2014 to 2015 occuring in those four provinces makes up for more than half of all the trafficking occurring nationwide.

The project want to add another factor, the perspective of gender quality in that province. Data will be extracted from the [2018 World Value Survey in China](https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV7.jsp). In this long questionnare, there are seven questions related to gender equality, including:

- Q28: Pre-school child suffers with working mother
- Q29: Men make better political leaders than women do
- Q30: University is more important for a boy than for a girl
- Q31: Men make better business executives than women do
- Q32: Being a housewife just as fulfilling
- Q33: Jobs scarce: Men should have more right to a job than women
- Q35: Problem if women have more income than husband

I will group by province to see the score of gender equality in each province, as well as considering the GDP, gender ratio and new-born gender ratio from [2010 China Census Data](http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/pcsj/rkpc/6rp/indexch.htm). And visualize them in a map.

## Limitations

Not all the women trafficking cases will be reported and sued, which may lead to the inaccuracy of data from the collection side. However, data can reveal at least some pattern of this vulnarable group. And hope one day a more completed data set can be built to record all of them.
